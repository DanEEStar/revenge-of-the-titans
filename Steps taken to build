Here are steps I've taken to try to compile this.
- Download the original source. Very important.
- Initialize as a git repo (any VCS will do, but I'm using git).
- Create a project in Netbeans. I had leftover plugins from my previous installation that integrate nicely with git. Ant's in their too.
- Converting encoding of all source files from ASCII (ANSI) to UTF-8 without BOM. Why was it in ANSI in the first place?
- Added missing included libraries (in libs/)
- Looked up the package net.java.dev.eval - It's an expression evaluator. Download here: http://java.net/projects/eval/pages/Home
- Found out the source files I had were missing a few files, redownloaed and replaced.
- This cut down the # of errors from 100 to about 77.
- There were some references are references to a Steam specific package. Comment those out.
- Missing method in lwjgl. The original library might be outdated. Downloaded 2.8.3 (and docs & source just for fun). I was right!
- Errors down to 55.
